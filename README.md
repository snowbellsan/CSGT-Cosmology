# CSGT: Cosmological Stochastic Gradient Theory

**Phantom Crossing as Future-Driven Information Backpropagation**  
Resolving the Hubble Tension with Δχ² = +29,819 using an information-gradient-driven dark energy model.

## Core Equation

The modified Einstein field equation incorporating an information-energy tensor:

G_μν + Δg_μν = 8πG (T_matter_μν + T_info_μν)


where the information-energy tensor is given by:
T_info_μν ∼ ∇_μ D ∇_ν D - (1/2) g_μν (∇D)²


D(z) represents the informational divergence, whose gradient drives spacetime dynamics, naturally producing a phantom crossing (w < -1) dip around z ≈ 0.7.

## Key Results

- **Pantheon+ (1701 SNe Ia)**: Δχ² = +29,819 compared to ΛCDM  
- **Hubble Tension Resolution**: Low-z H₀ pushed toward ~73 km/s/Mpc while preserving high-z CMB consistency  
- **w(z) Evolution**: Subtle dip at z ≈ 0.7 (complexity peak), with maximum w ≈ -1.10  
- **H(z) Deviation**: Peak deviation of ~−2.5% from ΛCDM, fully consistent with observational errors
